	            <p>Climate Change is the long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns thes shifts might be natural for example solar cycle but for around 200 years the human activites have been the main cause of climate change primarily from burning fossil fuels like coal,oil and gas</p>

	            <h1> What is Climate change doing right now</h1>
	            <p>Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues.Climate change is already heating up the plant, the arctic is melting very fast.</p>
